From the main font of Infinitime the Cyrillic characters are replaced with special characters of the Finnish, Swedish and Polish languages.
This helps you when you are using GadgetBridge as a companion app. You can turn off transliteration and enjoy perfectly readable notifications. 
The font modification is first tested on InfiniSim and then on my personal sealed pinetime, before it's uploaded here. So you can be pretty sure that it works.
